Idea: MVP app to ingest RegInsight CSV data, embed texts semantically, get cosine similarities (over time), and plot via minimal Streamlit UI. 
Here is the User story: 
“Reg analysts covering AI ethics want to know when other jurisdictions start talking about AI enforcement in the same language
 as the EU (for exampel) so they can anticipate regulatory pressure building globally and flag it early to legal team.
 When language diverges, this may show that regulation is about to split off, leading to unpredicted new regulation, 
 or when they converge, this could predict future regulation based on the past behaviour of the similar party.”
