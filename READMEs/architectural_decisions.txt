1. Ingestion - purpose is to ingest CSV data into PG table, and clean data.
data validation with pydantic model - all inherit from one model to prevent data drift
run regularly with cronjob for now - later use Pub/Sub + Cloud Function for event driven ingestion
batch ingestion, for scalability (deal with memory constraints, and parallelism-ready)
won't add logging for this MVP but batching would help that too, could log where it goes wrong
secrets - using .env for now, would use GCP Secrets Manager for Prod.
